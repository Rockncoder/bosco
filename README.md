## Firebase

There is one missing file, src/environments/firebase.json. It contains all of your firebase configuration information.

```
{
  apiKey: "xxxxxxxxxxxxxcxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  authDomain: "xxxxxxxxx.firebaseapp.com",
  databaseURL: "https://xxxxxxxxxxx.firebaseio.com",
  storageBucket: "xxxxxxxxxxxxxx.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "xxxxxxxxxxx"
};
```
You need to generate this JSON file yourself based on information from Firebase.
And keep it secret.
